## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are essential for writing efficient and effective code. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and implementing these concepts. Each data structure and algorithm is accompanied by explanations, use cases, and code examples.

## Features

- Implementations of various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables).
- Implementations of common algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms).
- Code examples in multiple programming languages.
- Detailed explanations and use cases for each data structure and algorithm.
- Unit tests for each implementation to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/agneepradeep/Data-Structures-And-Algorithm-Analysis.git
    cd Data-Structures-And-Algorithm-Analysis
    ```

2. **Navigate to the relevant directory**:
    Each data structure and algorithm is organized into separate directories. Navigate to the desired directory to find the implementation and related files.

3. **Run the code**:
    Follow the instructions in the specific directory's README or comments in the code files to compile and run the implementations.
